KNOWNS ISSUES:

- Scenario 1:
    - 1 attack can cause double damage
    - 5 attack() called with 4 attacking animation only 
- Reason:
    - fighter.attack() function being called continuously when attack animation is not finished yet.
- Solution:
    - In fighter.attack(), set isAttacking to true only when animation is reset (framesCurrent = 0)

TODO:

Features:
    - Add more fighter
